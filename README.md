# Purpose

This repository contains a set of guidelines for a simple code review flow centred around a GitHub repository.

# Tools

## Installation

The `installation_scripts` directory contains installation scripts for the tools mentioned below.

**Note:** Most scripts currently assume that they are run on a Mac OS machine.

## Always know where you are

`./install_git_prompt.sh` modifies your command line prompt to show the current git branch (if you are inside a git repository).

## Install handy git shortcuts

`./install_git_toolbelt.sh` installs `git-toolbelt` - a set of excellent git commands which automate common workflows.

**Note:** The installation script assumes that you have the `brew` package manager installed.
